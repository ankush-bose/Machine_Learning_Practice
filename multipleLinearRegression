/*Overview
 The model predicts the area burnt due to forest fire based on temperature, rain, RH, wind, ISI, DMC, FFMC, month, day. The model works uses multiple linear regression to predict. Furthermore, backward elimination is used to optimise and develop a better testing model.

This is a step by step guide on how the model works:
We have to import three libraries
Step 1:Importing Libraries
We have to import three libraries: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib
Pandas is used for importing dataset and arranging it.
Numpy is used to take care the missing data in the dataset.
Matplotlib is used for the visualisation of the test, train and prediction.
We are renaming pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib as matplt 

Step 2: Importing Dataset
The dataset file 'forest_fire.csv' is initialised in the variable 'dataset' using a function 'read_csv()' from pandas library.
The columns from 1 to 12 is assigned to a variable 'X' .The column is 
dataset= pd.read_csv('forest_data.csv')
X=dataset.iloc[:,1:12].values
y=dataset.iloc[:,-1].values
*\


import numpy as np
import matplotlib as matlp
import pandas as pd


#Importing Dataset

dataset= pd.read_csv('forest_data.csv')
X=dataset.iloc[:,1:12].values
y=dataset.iloc[:,-1].values
